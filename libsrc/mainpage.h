/** \mainpage Vagabond documentation v0.0
 *  
 * \section Introduction
 *
 * This is the documentation for Vagabond for both users and developers.
 *
 * \section Installation
 *
 * The easiest way to install Vagabond for users is from an AppImage (on
 * Linux) or the distributed .app file (for Mac OS X). Vagabond is not
 * available on Windows and has not been tested on it.
 *
 * Developers will need to get the latest version from Github and compile from
 * source (https://www.github.com/helenginn/vagabond).
 *
 * \section Tutorial
 *
 * A tutorial on Vagabond would be sensible, but maybe once I've figured out
 * how the GUI will be settled.
 *
 * \section Manual
 *
 * There will be a manual on Vagabond.
 *
 * \section Code documentation
 *
 * Documentation on the code is available. Start by having a look at the 
 * Classes.
