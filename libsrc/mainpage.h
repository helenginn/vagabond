/** \mainpage Vagabond documentation v0.0
 *  
 * \section Introduction
 *
 * This is the documentation for Vagabond for both users and developers.
 *
 * \section Installation
 *
 * Right now, you will need to get the latest version from Github and compile 
 * from source (https://www.github.com/helenginn/vagabond). Vagabond is not
 * available and will crash on Windows.
 *
 * Vagabond uses the Meson build system (https://www.mesonbuild.com) and has
 * the following dependencies (don't forget to install the _devel_ versions):
 * * libpng, fftw3f
 * * Qt5 (GUI only)
 *
 * \section Tutorial
 *
 * A tutorial on Vagabond would be sensible, but maybe once I've figured out
 * how the GUI will be settled.
 *
 * \section Manual
 *
 * There will be a manual on Vagabond.
 *
 * \section Documentation
 *
 * Documentation on the code is available. Start by having a look at the 
 * Classes.
 *
 * \section License
 * 
 * Vagabond is released under GPL v3.
